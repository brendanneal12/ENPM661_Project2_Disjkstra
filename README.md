Project 2 Goal: Solve a maze using Dijkstra Search Algorithm

File Names: ObstacleDefinitions.py, Project2_Main.py

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Python Version: 3

# GitHub Repository Link
https://github.com/brendanneal12/ENPM661_Project2_Disjkstra


# Libraries Used
numpy, OpenCV, from matplotlib: pyplot, math, timeit, queue, from queue: PriorityQueue

# How to Run Code
1. Make sure both files are loaded into workspace.
2. Hit "Run" for ObstacleDefinitions.py
3. Switch to dijkstra_brendan_neal.py
4. Hit Run
5. Observe the Workspace in displayed on screen, then close the window.
6. Prompted by the terminal, enter the Initial Node state, X and Y, with spaces separating them. Example: 5 5
7. If your initial state is in an obstacle or outside of the workspace, you will be prompted to restart.
8. Prompted by the terminal, enter the Goal Node state, X and Y, with spaces separating them. Example: 250 25
9. If your goal state is in an obstacle or outside of the workspace, you will be prompted to restart.
10. Observe the Possible Moves printed to the terminal as the Dijkstra search runs.
11. Once the Dijkstra search finishes, the completed map is displayed to screen, the total cost of the path is printed to the terminal, the time it took to complete the search is printed to the terminal, and a video file named "dijkstra_brendan_neal.mp4" is added to the workspace.
12. Open the video file outside of VSCode to watch the animation of the search and backtracking.

# IMPORTANT NOTES PLEASE READ
1. There is no visual representation of the search and backtracking while the search is taking place. The only way to view the animation is to open the generated video file.

2. Please click the following link in order to view an example output video that is produced by my code. Initial State is 5 5, Goal State is 300 225. I cannot commit the video directly to GitHub since the file size is way too large: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17SJckOGSsYpg5Na8HCx6JNp36jlN5ils
